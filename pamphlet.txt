The Fantasy author, Jim Butcher, mentioned the Loup-Garou in his "Dresden Files" series. He described it as being "a person, cursed to become a wolf-like demon, during a full moon".
The Loup-Garou is VERY real. And it is very non-wolf.
The Loup-Garou is a person who has become possessed by a demon or evil elemental spirit after a backfired summoning. The 'wolf-like' description comes from the slightly canine-like head. Other than that, the person, from the night before a full moon, to the night of, becomes 7-8 feet tall, with sleek, rippling muscles, the aforementioned canine-like muzzle, and horrid black or red eyes.
Unless you have some sort of silver weapon, you cannot hope to defeat someone in their Loup-Garou form. They are much more resilient to damage than their werewolf cousins, including fire, large-caliber weapons, even acid. The only known ways to defeat a Loup-Garou are:
1. A Headshot with silver bullets or Decaptation via a blessed Silver Blade
2. Lure them to Holy Light and keep them in the Light for 1 hour (which ends the possession and saves the person's life)
3. Find the Summoning Circle that was used and break it; this MAY sever the tie (if it's an Elemental) but isn't guaranteed (if the Demon has a firm enough hold).
